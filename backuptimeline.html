              First, we will ask you about your requirements, goals, etc. This
              is the first step and it’s all about listening to you and asking
              you questions related to gathering information so that we can
              align with your vision.

              Before starting the development, we create a visual print of the
              project and discuss it with our customers. This helps in giving a
              sneak peek at the layout, design, and functionality. After which
              we do a settlement with the client to make sure we give what they
              want.

            not give him.
